    <h1>An Interface With Problems: Thermostats</h1>
    <h2>Personas and Storyboarding</h2>
    <body>
        <div class="storyboard-container">
            <p>This project ultimately provides a strong framework of a "problem" that can be used for further design work to come up with a solution for creating simpler and more user-friendly thermostats.</p>
            A thermostat is a device used to detect temperature changes for the purpose of maintaining the temperature of an enclosed area essentially constant. It’s requirements to function are simple: a user needs to be able to set a desired temperature for the AC. Here is a sketch of a thermostat:

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I started by recording observations while interviewing multiple thermostat users. I asked the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What temperature do you prefer to maintain at home?</li>
            <li>Would you describe this interface as “simple”?</li>
            <li>Do you know how to create a temperature schedule?</li>
            <li>Do you know the difference between “cool” and “heat” when you set the thermostat to the same temperature?</li>
            <li>Do you know the difference between the “system” and “fan” switches?</li>
            <li>Do you know which rooms you are setting the temperature for?</li>
            <li>How would you describe the thermostat?</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Observations</h3>  
        <ul>
            <li>The thermostat has multiple buttons that are never used.</li>
            <li>Users are unsure of which rooms are affected by the thermostat.</li>   
            <li>Users are unsure of what each button does.</li>
            <li>Users failed at knowing how to use each button, thus the interface failed the users.</li>   
      
        </ul>
     
        <h3>Interview Themes</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>Users only want to set a temperature or turn off the system.</li>
            <li>Context for which rooms are affected was missing.</li>
            <li>There was inadequate visual feedback.</li>
            <li>The interface is dated when compared to any modern technologies users interact with on a daily basis.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>Based on the above, I created the following two personas:</p>
        <div class="storyboard-container">
            <img class="persona" src="./assets/coldcolin.jpg" alt="Personas">
            <img class="persona" src="./assets/environmentaledna.jpg" alt="Personas">
        </div>

        <h3>Storyboard</h3>
        <p>Lastly, I created this storyboard to show the experience of the first of my two personas: Cold Colin</p>
        <div class="storyboard-container">
            <img class="storyboard" src="./assets/storyboard.jpeg" alt="storybaord">
        </div>
        <p>As stated above, these issues provide a strong foundation for potential solutions for simpler thermostats.</p>
